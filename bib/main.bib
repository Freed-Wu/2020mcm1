 abstract={According to the development status of China鈥檚 tourism industry to study tourism industry risk and crisis prevention mechanism, the establishment of tourism economic early warning model is proposed, the model is divided into clear warning, tracing the warning source, alarm analysis, alarm level, and the logical process of alarm suffer release. At the same time, to establish the tourism economic early warning model framework and to analyze the tourism economic early warning model factor, and then to calculate the tourism economic early warning model index factor weighting from the target layer and the rule layer. Finally, the establishment of tourism economic early warning index to improves the development of tourism industry and the defense ability to resist unexpected events.},

 abstract={As rapid development of economy and people's gradually great Attention to energy environmental problems,more and more researchers have started researching the relationship between economy, energy and environment, we urgently need methods and models to solve the disagreement between them, and so 3E-based forecast and early-warning models began to emerge, and develop towards high-precision and comprehensive direction as the needs of social development. This paper described and analyzed several key forecast and early-warning models by now, and specifically explored these models' development trend.},
